- [2026-04-21 LayerSummary Discriminated Union](decisions/2026-04-21-layer-summary-discriminated-union.md) — Lift `LayerSummary` into `@ogden/shared/scoring` as a 41-variant discriminated union keyed by `layerType`; boundary coercers drop `'Unknown'`/`'N/A'` sentinels to `null`; closes audit §5.6 and deletes `formatPct` guard
- [2026-04-21 SSURGO chfrags + basesat disambiguation](decisions/2026-04-21-ssurgo-chfrags-basesat.md) — Query `chfrags.fragvol_r` for canonical horizon-total coarse fragments; expose `base_saturation_pct` preferring `basesatall_r` (sum-of-cations) with `base_saturation_method` discriminant; closes audit H5 #4
- [2026-04-21 NwisGroundwaterAdapter + PgmnGroundwaterAdapter](decisions/2026-04-21-nwis-groundwater-adapter.md) — Server-side lift of USGS NWIS (US) + Ontario PGMN (CA) groundwater; `groundwater` promoted to Tier-1 in `ADAPTER_REGISTRY`; web-side fallback retained; closes audit H5 #7
- [2026-04-21 Tier-3 Pipeline Cleanup](decisions/2026-04-21-tier3-pipeline-cleanup.md) — Microclimate enqueue moved into terrain worker's `finally` (eliminates first-attempt race); watershed `attempts: 2 → 3`; US projects emit 10 ScoredResult labels (CA: 11); Rodale re-verified end-to-end, parity Δ=0.000
- [2026-04-22 AI Outputs Persistence](decisions/2026-04-22-ai-outputs-persistence.md) — `ai_outputs` table + `NarrativeWorker` + `GET /projects/:id/ai-outputs`; narrative + design-recommendation persisted server-side after Tier-3; 4 duplicated writer-invocation blocks collapsed into `handleTier3Completion`; closes audit §6.13
- [2026-04-22 fuzzyMCDM Shared Integration](decisions/2026-04-22-fuzzymcdm-shared-integration.md) — fuzzyMCDM lifted to `@ogden/shared/scoring`; `ScoredResult.fuzzyFAO?` optional; opt-in `computeAssessmentScores(..., { scoringMode: 'fuzzy' })`; closes audit §6.9
- [2026-04-22 Regional Cost Dataset](decisions/2026-04-22-regional-cost-dataset.md) — `CostSource` metadata on every row; split into `regionalCosts/US_MIDWEST.ts` + `regionalCosts/CA_ONTARIO.ts`; 19 primary citations (NRCS EQIP, USDA NASS, NREL, OMAFRA, OSCIA, NRCan RETScreen, Trees Ontario, etc.); remainder flagged `citation: null` + `confidence: 'low'`; closes audit §6.10
- [2026-04-22 Southern-Ontario Municipal Zoning Registry](decisions/2026-04-22-ontario-municipal-zoning-registry.md) — `MUNICIPAL_ZONING_REGISTRY` of 5 verified ArcGIS REST endpoints (Toronto / Ottawa / Mississauga / Burlington / Barrie) with bbox pre-filter; `OntarioMunicipalAdapter.fetchForBoundary` rewired as three-source parallel merge (municipal + LIO + CLI); new confidence ladder (`high` = municipal bylaw + AAFC CLI); `ZoningSummary` extended with 5 optional municipal fields; closes audit §6 #6 (Ontario portion)
- [2026-04-22 Country 'INTL' bucket + NasaPowerAdapter registration](decisions/2026-04-22-country-intl-and-nasapower-registration.md) — `Country` widened to `['US','CA','INTL']`; `ADAPTER_REGISTRY` relaxed to `Partial<Record<Country,…>>`; `climate.INTL` → `NasaPowerAdapter`; DB migration 011 adds `CHECK` constraint; `AssessmentFlag.country` deduped to shared enum; non-US/non-CA projects unblocked for climate layer; closes audit §6 #15
- [2026-04-22 Site Assessment Panel server-wiring](decisions/2026-04-22-site-assessment-panel-server-wiring.md) — `useAssessment(projectId)` hook added + `AssessmentResponse` schema; `SiteAssessmentPanel` three-state display (server row · NOT_READY preview · error fallback) surfaces persisted Tier-3 scores; closes audit §6 #14
- [2026-04-22 Feature Manifest Scaffolding Pass §§1-30](decisions/2026-04-22-feature-manifest-scaffolding-pass.md) — Framework (manifest, phase-gate plugin, generator, FUTURE tag) + 28 scaffolded section stubs across 8 commits `87d1a56` → `c02f75e` on `feat/shared-scoring`; downstream sessions land on mountable surfaces driven by `packages/shared/src/featureManifest.ts`
- [2026-04-23 OKLCH Token Migration](decisions/2026-04-23-oklch-token-migration.md) — OKLCH primitives in `tokens.css`; `@supports`-gated dark-mode overrides so hex remains authoritative on unsupporting browsers; elevation ladder derivable from L-steps; closes audit §§2+4 P0/P1
- [2026-04-23 DelayedTooltip Primitive](decisions/2026-04-23-delayed-tooltip-primitive.md) — `<DelayedTooltip>` as 800 ms preset over existing `<Tooltip>`; `title=` replaced across `IconSidebar` + map control chrome; paired with `.signifier-shimmer` active-state utility; closes audit §6 P0
